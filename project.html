        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <img src="dan.jpg" alt="Daniel Njenga" class="profile-photo"> 
        <p>Hello! I'm Daniel Njenga, a dedicated student at Garissa University, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Education with a specialization in History and Religion. While my academic journey has been rooted in the humanities, I have always been deeply passionate about the world of technology, particularly in the areas of software development, artificial intelligence (AI), and e-commerce solutions.</p>

           <p> Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and leadership—skills that I believe are transferable and essential in the world of tech. My interest in software engineering began early, and I have since taken steps to expand my knowledge and experience in the field, especially with programming languages like Python, Django, and PHP.</p>
            
           <p> I am also particularly interested in AI-powered solutions for businesses, and I am excited about the potential of using technology to solve real-world problems. As I continue to pursue my software engineering scholarship and develop my skills, I look forward to combining my education background with my passion for technology to create impactful tools that can make a difference.</p>
            
            Future Goals My long-term goal is to become a skilled software engineer and contribute to the development of innovative AI-driven solutions that can revolutionize industries, especially in e-commerce. I am eager to use my expertise to build technologies that can empower businesses and individuals alike, making everyday tasks more efficient and accessible.
            
            In addition to my technical ambitions, I aim to leverage my education background to contribute to tech education, helping others understand the intersection of technology and learning.
            
            When I'm not coding or learning about AI, you’ll find me reading about the latest tech trends, exploring new programming languages, and thinking about how technology can improve various aspects of life and business.</p>
